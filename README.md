# Sounder
Designing + Fabrication of a Sounder using Proteus 
_________________________________________________________________________
The project is done in 4 phases:
1. Schematic Design
2. PCB Design
3. Coding & Simulation
4. Fabrication
______________________________________
Project Specification:
  1.	Microcontroller: ATMega328P, compound with a By-Pass Capacitors
  2.	Power Circuitry: Using LM7805 (Input: 10V -> Output: 5V)
  3.	Crystal: XTAL, 16MHz with 2x22pF Capacitors, one on each Pin
  4.	One ON/OFF switch
  5.	One Push button to reset
  6.	Sounder to make the desired frequency
  7.	LED to imitate the sounder frequency using PWM
  8.	Potentiometer to change the frequency
  9.	One 2x3 ISP connector to program the AVR, since I wanted to make the real PCB and board.
  10.	Terminal to print the frequency and take the user's wanted frequency.
