# PCB Design
The PCB dimensions: ~ 70mm x 60 mm
______________________________
# Description: 
After designing the schematics and the circuit diagram in the first part of the project, We go through the PCB design.
First of all, we make a board and set its dimensions to 60x70 mm2, then we try to set the components that are the same and also belong to each other close and near to each other.
Also, we should follow the wires rules, like avoiding sharp turns (angles) in wires.
To make the PCB, the executable components are listed in the component list at the left sidebar in proteus, and could be added to the board one by one. Then they get connected to their related parts using wires.
